Install the Plugin in MySQL using:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN icu SONAME 'libmysql-icu.so';

Edit your /etc/mysql/my.cnf and add the following lines somewhere under [mysqld]

[mysqld]
#
# normal options
# ...

# mysql-icu plugin options
# A space separated list of ICU locales to use for collation:
icu_locales = my_MM th
# An optional file in which to place custom collation rules
# Uncomment and adjust the path to enable
#icu_custom_collation_file=/etc/mysql/my.txt
#
# An optional file in which to place ICU word break rules, which are used
# to find words for indexing.
#icu_custom_wordbreak_file=/etc/mysql/myword.txt
#
# Enable use of custom word break rules for all UTF8 and UCS2 charsets
# (assumes icu_custom_wordbreak_file has been specified)
#icu_use_custom_wordbreak_for_all=1


Restart mysql for the changes to take affect. Note that changing these values
after the plugin has been loaded currently has no affect. You will need to
restart mysql.

If the plugin is loaded successfully you should be able to see the ICU
collation options with:

mysql> show collation like '%icu%';

You can then set your tables to collate using your chosen ICU collation.
See the MySQL Manual for details on how to set a collation on a table, column
or query. e.g.

mysql> ALTER TABLE testCollate COLLATE = utf8_icu_root_ci;
mysql> SELECT * FROM testCollate ORDER BY word COLLATE utf8_icu_my_MM_ci;
